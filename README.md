# Monotonic Recourse Measures
Monotonic Recourse Measures (MRM) and Monotonic Recourse Measures with Clustering (MRMC) are methods for Algorithmic Recourse drawing from previous work by Datta et al (1).

The primary contribution of this repository is an implementation of MRM and MRMC. It also includes
* A framework for iterating directional recourse
* Directional implementations of DiCE and FACE to be used as benchmarks
* A set of experiments analyzing the performance of MRMC
* A set of notebooks demonstrating usage of MRMC.
